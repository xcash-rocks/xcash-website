          <p class="h1-subtitles"><strong>Built to remove scaling limitations while enhancing overall security, X-Cash's blockchain expands Blockchain processing capabilities through its Private implementation of DPOS, thus enabling the crypto playground for all to coalesce.</strong></p>

          <strong>
            <span class="orange">Staking</span> <br/>The X-Cash Blockchain is secured by delegates who are elected by XCASH holders. By providing your vote through an XCASH reserve proof, you are electing a representative to secure the network and forge new blocks, who will in return split the block reward with you.<br/><br/>
            <span class="orange">DBFT </span> <br/> Our unique implementation of DBFT in consensus grants the X-Cash Blockchain immunity to forks, henceforth instantly validating new transactions.<br/><br/>
            <span class="orange">Randomized Block Producer Selection</span> <br/> The selection of the next block-producing delegate is completely randomized through our use of Verifiable Random Functions (VRF), therefore increasing the security of our delegates by preventing attacks to the next block producer.<br/><br/>
            <span class="orange">Stake Delegation with Reserve Proofs</span> <br/>Instead of sending your stake to another wallet to vote toward a delegate, you are providing a cryptographic reserve proof of your funds to your delegate, meaning that you keep complete control of your crypto at all times.
