            <span class="orange">Staking</span> <br/><span class="unbolden-text">The X-Cash Blockchain is secured by delegates who are elected by XCASH holders. By voting with an XCASH proof of funds (auto-generated), you elect a node who will in return split the block reward with you.</span>
            <span class="underline-stake">⚠️Never send a coin to stake⚠️</span><br><br>
            <span class="orange">Randomized Block Producer Selection</span> <br/><span class="unbolden-text">The selection of the next block-producing delegate is random due to our use of Verifiable Random Functions (VRF), therefore increasing the security of our network by preventing attacks to the next block producer.</span><br/><br/>
            <span class="orange">Stake Delegation with Reserve Proofs</span> <br/><span class="unbolden-text">Instead of sending your stake to another wallet to vote toward a delegate, you are providing a cryptographic reserve proof of your funds to your delegate, meaning that you keep complete control of your crypto at all times.</span><br/><br/>
            <span class="orange">DBFT: Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance</span> <br/> <span class="unbolden-text">As compared to the existing implementations of BFT, our DBFT consensus is the BFT protocol upgraded to meet the requirements of a massively-scaled blockchain. To optimize data transmission, block producer selection is made using VRFs while consensus data such as reserve proofs are stored off-chain. X-Cash DBFT has delegates submit data to hash after voting on its validiity. By exchanging hash data, delegates are quickly able to determine if the current hash of one delegate is the same as all current hashes.</span><br/><br/>
            <span class="underline-stake">The X-Cash blockchain is immune to forks.</span>
