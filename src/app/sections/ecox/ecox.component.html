          <strong class="orange">An Energy-Efficient Algorithm.<br/></strong>Unlike Proof-of-Work blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, or POS blockchains which require wallets to remain open, X-Cash's Private DPOS requires significantly less
          energy making it the ideal platform for building eco-friendly blockchain applications.

          however, while we're confident that this estimate is accurate, we encourage you to dispute this claim and if a more accurate counter assessment is made (with
          demonstrable workings) then we will update the figures along with workings: and give you credit where it is due.
